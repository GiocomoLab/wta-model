# wta-model
Code implements the WTA model used to model grid-to-place interactions described in Mallory et al., 2017. 

The main script is run_wta.m This create two populations of place cells - each population representing the activity of place cells on one day. The activity maps of each populatiof place cells is generated by combining activity maps of grid cells and unstable spatial inputs through a winner-take-all mechanism as described in Lyttle et al., 2013 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120775/).
