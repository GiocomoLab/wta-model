# wta-model

Code implements the WTA model used to model grid-to-place interactions described in Mallory et al., 2017. 

The main script is run_wta.m. This script will create two populations of place cells - each population represents the activity of place cells in a 50 cm x 50 cm environment on one day. The activity maps of each population of place cells is generated by combining activity maps of grid cells and unstable spatial inputs through a winner-take-all mechanism as described in Lyttle et al., 2013 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120775/).
